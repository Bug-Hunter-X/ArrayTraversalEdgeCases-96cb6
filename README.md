# Off-by-One Error in Java
This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over arrays. The error occurs because the loop condition `i <= array.length` attempts to access an index that is out of bounds. 

The `Bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `BugSolution.java` shows the corrected version.  Understanding and avoiding off-by-one errors is crucial for writing robust and reliable Java code.
